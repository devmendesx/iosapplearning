# iOS Developer Bootcamp


I started to learn from two courses where I choose which my friends recommended to me.
The first one is from a portuguese professor where I learned Android since 2020, and then I stopped his course 
to learn from a better course called iOS & Swift - The complete iOS Developer Bootcamp which is taught by Angela.

1. First course started with Jamilton Damasceno
    1. [Desenvolvimento IOS 12 - Aprenda a criar 18 Apps](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-desenvolvimento-ios/)
2. Second course which is better with Dr. Angela Yu
    1. [iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/)


*__I put all lessons and projects together, so sorry for that but I was running on my way and didn't realize that it was in the same folder.__*
